    Currently this app allows for real time communications through the use of web sockets. 
    A user can change their name by editing the input in the name field and pressing enter to confirm. 
    Currently a user can also preview their name in a different color by clicking on the color wheel and selecting a color.
    This feature is not complete as this color feature does not transfer when a user posts a message.--To be completed by July
    
    Thank you and I look forward to your feedback.
